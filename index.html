    <h2>Hello,</h2>
    <p>Here are some of my projects that I've worked on in my time with Eduvos, keep in mind that I am 
      still a student and I am still learning, so these projects are not perfect
       but they are a good representation of my skills and what I can do. There are still many more projects 
       to come as I continue to learn and grow in the field of IT. I hope you enjoy browsing through my work and
        if you have any questions or tips, feel free to reach out to me via the contact page. Thank you 
        for visiting my portfolio!
